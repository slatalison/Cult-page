            <p>Gacha, also known as Gachanism, is a fictional cult created by first year Parsons MFADT student Senyuan
                "Allie" Xiao in her Major Studio 2 multimedia project "a future cult". The creation of Gacha is inspired
                by mobile games and real cults including Heaven's gate. </p>
            <p>As the project says, Gacha is first described in 2031 and
                organised as a movement in April 2032 by American Moon Jones. Practices are the core of Gacha, and they
                emphasise the importance of connectedness with Gospel saintess, and also patience and diligence. Through
                moral rectitude and praying, practitioners of Gacha aspire to enhance personal strength, and ultimately
                change a virtual world.</p>
            <p>In the "future cult" project, Gacha began to be widely practiced in the early 2030s, faring particularly
                well in Japan, China, Korea
                and the United States. Other than the main countries, Gacha is gaining popularity worldwide.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>The project was initiated in Feburary 2020 under the theme "augmentation", which can be interperated here
                as "augmenting religous practice with digital media". Xiao chose to develop the theme in this particular
                way because of her life-long curiosity of cult as well as her passion in controlling human mind and
                behaviour with a set of rules. From an early age, Xiao has found irrational beliefs and behaviours, such
                as cult, superstitions, conspiracy theories, addiction, fascinating as a subject of study. She wants to
                understand how these beliefs and behaviours occurs, why they are persistent, and how to recreate similar
                experience in harmless way and deliver it to rational, sober audiences. </p>
            <p>In this project, she began with researching new media and technologies that can be used to augment any
                religous experience. Then she identified mobile game as the media, because she believes that mobile
                gaming and cult have interestingly many element in common. In the aspect of organisational structure, a
                typical cult appropriate classics and terminologies of multiple orthodox belief systems, and limits
                activities and thoughts of members with rigorous routine in order to bring members into the state of
                strong cognitive dissonance; a typical mobile game, similarly, adapt personalities and items in history
                or literature, and also requires long-hour, scheduled engagement with the game everyday. Based on the
                comparison and contrust, Xiao saw a potaintial with mobile game: it is technically possible to run a
                cult in the form of mobile game.</p>

            <h2>
                <span>Doctrine of Gacha</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Gacha is a syncretic belief system that draws upon a pop culture style of interpretations of elements of
                many traditional methology and belief, altered by a post-modern perspective. Materials come from nordic
                folk belief, Zoroastrianism and early Abrahamic religions including Jadaism and Christian, plot or
                character schema of classic Japanese manga, animation, and also figures from real history. The funder,
                Moon Jones, claimed that a "virtual world" is in the process of shaping up and seperating from
                the real world. The final effort of "Evocation"(the ultimate birth of the virtual world to the earth)
                must be done by Gacha believers. In 2032, Jones released the fundational application, declearing herself
                to be "a humble developer who happens to travelled to the virtural world", and that she was the only one
                to tell the truth lead people brining the vitural world to life. Once the "virtual world" is brought to
                life, as Jones wrote in the Gacha Gospel, "dream submerges reality, fantasy rules physics laws, and
                belief becomes power... Everything that has been believed to exist now trully exist... People shall meet
                their loved ones for the first time." But if one does not practice Gacha enough before the day comes,
                "shall be dissolved together with the dirts, constrains and laws on this planet."</p>
            <p>Jones' purported mission was to become be "messenger" between the vitural world and the real world.
                She claimed that the application was able to transmission users' spiritual power to "quantum brainwaves"
                that could add up to the strength of the vitural world. As Moon Jones (later created her avater, a
                cartoon charater named "Mitsuki"（Japanese：ミツキ；Chinese：光祈） claimed, she (and her avater, in the
                applicaion) represnets the will of the virtual world where saintesses come from. Althougn she required
                practitioners praying to her figure, she refered to "saintess"'s stories and exploited followers trust
                and expectation of saintesses for her own agenda.</p>


            <h2>
                <span>Practice</span>
            </h2>

            <h3>Structure of practice</h3>

            <p>A complete session of Gacha practice is a group of activities to be done in different times every day,
                all within the "vitural church". Jones is inspired by the way mobile gacha games attract their players
                and such principle was applied throughout the way she built the applictaion. The application is a
                assitance and a framework of people's practice, so that "Gacha's practitioners around the world are
                united under the belief of the virtual world". Activites include reading and reflecting gospel lections,
                donate, draw cards (gacha) for gaining offerings to saintnees. Practitioners should present offerings to
                saintess and update their practice progress manually, as a way to fully engage with the practice and
                deepen their understanding of lections. Gacha Practices may share some characteristics with common
                mobile gamin, but according to Jones, Gacha should not be recognised as a entertaining activity.</p>

            <h3>
                <span>Gospels, churches and shrines</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Gacha church takes the form of a mobile-game-like applicaion. Unlike most of the traditional religions,
                Gacha adherents engage with their daily religious practice with the "vitural church" installed in
                practitioners' devices. Only in rare cases do Gacha Shrines are constructed physically in the form of
                architecture. Gacha shrines are usually the electronic device where adherents engage with Gospels. The
                more gospels a practitioner is studying, the higher repetition they has.</p>
            <h3>
                <span>Donation and offering</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Accoriding to Jones, the quantum brainwave transmission is only possible with sufficient in-app donation,
                and that donation is the most important part of Gacha practice. By donating to the church, followers get
                extra times to pray and thus infuse their spiritual power to the application.</p>
